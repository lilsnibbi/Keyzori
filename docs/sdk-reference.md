# SDK reference

`keyzori` integrates Bun or Node.js desktop/server applications with a Keyzori server. It is not a browser SDK because hardware identification uses operating-system APIs.

## Requirements and installation

- Bun 1.3.14 or newer, or Node.js 18 or newer.
- An HTTPS Keyzori server URL (HTTP is accepted only for loopback development).
- A full `sk_...` secret returned when an administrator creates a license.

```powershell
bun add keyzori
```

The package is ESM and exports compiled JavaScript plus TypeScript declarations.

## Recommended integration

```typescript
import { LicenseClient } from "keyzori";

const client = new LicenseClient({
	apiKey: process.env.KEYZORI_LICENSE_KEY ?? "",
	serverUrl: "https://licenses.example.com",
	heartbeatIntervalMs: 30_000,
	maxRetries: 2,
	requestTimeoutMs: 10_000,
	logLevel: "warn",
});

client.events.on("ready", (customFields) => {
	console.info("License ready", customFields);
});

client.events.on("license:expired", (reason) => {
	console.error("License expired", reason);
});

client.events.on("license:revoked", (reason) => {
	console.error("License rejected", reason);
});

client.events.on("network:offline", (reason) => {
	console.error("License server unavailable", reason);
});

const customFields = await client.initialize();

async function shutdown(): Promise<never> {
	await client.destroy();
	process.exit(0);
}

process.once("SIGINT", () => void shutdown());
process.once("SIGTERM", () => void shutdown());
```

Attach event listeners before `initialize()` so the initial `ready` event cannot be missed.

## Exports

The package exports:

- `LicenseClient` — the public runtime API.
- `LicenseClientConfig`, `LicenseEvents`, `LicenseEventMap`, `KeyType`, and `LogLevel` TypeScript types.

Hardware identification, networking, response-size limits, and event dispatch are internal implementation details and are not public package exports.

## `LicenseClientConfig`

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apiKey` | `string` | Yes | — | Full license secret. Blank strings are rejected. |
| `serverUrl` | `string` | Yes | — | HTTPS base URL; HTTP is restricted to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]`. |
| `heartbeatIntervalMs` | `number` | No | `30000` | Delay after a completed heartbeat before the next request. Positive integer. |
| `maxRetries` | `number` | No | `2` | Consecutive retryable heartbeat failures before `network:offline`. Positive integer. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `number` | No | `10000` | Timeout applied to handshake and logout requests. Positive integer. |
| `logLevel` | `LogLevel` | No | `none` | Internal informational logging threshold. |

`LogLevel` is `"none" | "error" | "warn" | "info" | "debug"`. `none` silences all SDK logging, including fatal messages.

## `LicenseClient`

### Constructor

```typescript
new LicenseClient(config: LicenseClientConfig)
```

The constructor validates configuration and creates the hardware and network helpers. The server issues an opaque token during the first successful handshake, binds it to the admission IP/HWID context, and the SDK reuses it with the same HWID for heartbeats and logout.

### `events`

```typescript
readonly events: LicenseEvents
```

Register lifecycle listeners through this broker.

### `initialize()`

```typescript
initialize(): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>
```

Performs the first handshake. On success it:

1. validates the server response shape;
2. stores and returns `customFields`;
3. changes state to active;
4. emits `ready`;
5. schedules the heartbeat loop.

Concurrent calls share one initialization promise. Calls made while already active return the original custom fields without creating another loop.

An unsuccessful initial handshake rejects with an `Error`, logs according to `logLevel`, and destroys the client. A failed/destroyed instance cannot be reinitialized; create a new `LicenseClient` if retry policy requires a fresh session.

Typical initial error messages include:

- `License Block: Invalid API key`
- `License Block: Subscription expired`
- `License Block: Maximum concurrent sessions reached`
- `License server returned an invalid handshake response`
- request timeout or network errors from `fetch`

### `destroy()`

```typescript
destroy(): Promise<void>
```

Stops future heartbeats, sends one best-effort logout request, and removes every registered listener. It is idempotent: repeated calls return the same destruction promise.

If logout fails, destruction still completes. With `logLevel` at `warn` or above, the SDK reports that the session could not be released; Redis expiry remains the fallback.

## Events

| Event | Listener arguments | When emitted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ready` | `(customFields)` | Exactly once after initial validation succeeds. |
| `heartbeat:success` | `()` | A recurring handshake succeeds and its response is valid. |
| `heartbeat:failed` | `(error, strikes)` | A retryable heartbeat fails. It also fires on the final strike. |
| `license:expired` | `(reason)` | A heartbeat returns `403` with a reason containing `expired`. |
| `license:revoked` | `(reason)` | A heartbeat returns any other `403`, including revocation and policy rejection. |
| `network:offline` | `(error)` | Consecutive retryable failures reach `maxRetries`. |

After `license:expired`, `license:revoked`, or `network:offline`, the client destroys itself. Event handlers should disable licensed functionality or close the application according to product policy.

Successful heartbeats reset the consecutive-failure count to zero. Heartbeats are scheduled only after the previous request finishes, so a slow request cannot overlap the next one.

## Event subscriptions

The `client.events` property implements `LicenseEvents`:

```typescript
on<K>(event: K, listener: LicenseEventMap[K]): void
once<K>(event: K, listener: LicenseEventMap[K]): void
removeListener<K>(event: K, listener: LicenseEventMap[K]): void
```

Event emission and bulk listener cleanup are internal. `destroy()` removes registered listeners after its logout attempt finishes.

Consumer listener exceptions are contained and reported at `warn` level so they cannot interrupt license-state enforcement or prevent other listeners from running.

When removing a listener, pass the same function reference used during registration:

```typescript
const onHeartbeat = () => console.info("still licensed");
client.events.on("heartbeat:success", onHeartbeat);
client.events.removeListener("heartbeat:success", onHeartbeat);
```

## Runtime and security considerations

- Treat the full license key as a credential. Do not log or embed it in public source.
- Use HTTPS outside loopback development; the SDK rejects remote cleartext URLs.
- The SDK performs policy enforcement in application code; determined users controlling the host may modify that application. Combine licensing with server-side authorization for high-value operations.
- `customFields` are customer-visible and must not contain secrets.
- Ensure application shutdown awaits `destroy()` when possible, while still relying on the 45-second server TTL after crashes.
